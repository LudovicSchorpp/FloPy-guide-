 Aquifer head is set to  1.00000E+30 at cells with IDOMAIN = 0.
 Aquifer head is set to -1.00000E+30 at all dry cells when Newton-Raphson rewetting is not active.
 
 
 Default stress package boundary face options (IFACE):
   RCH will be assigned to face  6
   EVT will be assigned to face  6

Combined Pathline and Timeseries Analysis (Simulation type = 4)
Backward tracking (Tracking direction = 2)
Let particles pass through weak sink cells (Weak sink option = 1)
Let particles pass through weak source cells for backtracking simulations (Weak source option = 1)
Reference time will be calculated for: Period      1 Step      1
The relative time position within the time step is = 0.0000000
Computed reference time =   0.0000000E+00
Specify a limit for tracking time (Stoping time option =  3)
Stop time =   0.8640010E+06

A zone array will be read.
Particles will be allowed to pass through all zones. StopZone =    -1

               ZONE ARRAY =              1 FOR LAYER   1

               ZONE ARRAY =              1 FOR LAYER   2
