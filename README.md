# FloPy-guide-
A little repository with some basic notebooks which explain how to preprocess and integrate data into modflow models with FloPy.

Following topics are discussed:
- Modflow 6 and Modflow 2005
- Basics packages (How to run the simpliest model ever (i.e. print ("Hello World") but FloPy's style !)
- Implemntation of simple Boundary Conditions (CHD, WEL, RIV, DRN, ...)
- Create and manipulate unstructured grid
- Usage of shapefiles and raster to improve model "realism"
- Inversions with PyEmu and Pest++

Soon : 
- Temporal discretisation and transient simulations
- Complex BCs (SFR, MAW,...)
- Transport modelling and density dependant flow (MT3D and SEAWAT)
- ...
